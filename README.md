# command-handler
Command Handler Template, exclusive by **Blob Project.**<br>
• discord.js (v12.5.1)<br>
• Node.js (v14.x)<br>

# Configuration
- Run `npm i` (you can use `--save` options, but that's fine)
- Put your token inside `.env` file after `TOKEN=`
- Run `node .` or `node server` might work too (run `node shard` if you have more than 2.000 servers)

## I have an issues with this template.
