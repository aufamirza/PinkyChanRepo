# Pinky Chan Repository

> This is Pinky Chan Readme for github.

These commands were written by some pretty awesome people, which include our Main and Regular Helpers, and our Developer! Check out our staff list [here](https://bit.ly/pinkyweb).

> We've created a [server](https://discord.gg/h4nsHSarpv) for people to test commands, chat about them, get help (with commands), and also track commands that are being worked on!
